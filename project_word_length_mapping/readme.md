**📝 Word Length Mapping**
**📌 Description**

This Python program creates a dictionary that maps each word to its corresponding length.
It demonstrates how to combine loops, string operations, and dictionary manipulation in a simple, practical way.

**🚀 Features**

Iterates through a list of words.

Calculates the number of characters in each word.

Stores each word–length pair in a dictionary.

Displays the complete mapping of words to their lengths.

**🧠 Step-by-Step Logic**

Create an empty dictionary to hold word–length pairs.

Go through each word in the predefined list.

Calculate its length using a string length function.

Store the word as a key and its length as the value.

Finally, display the dictionary showing each word and its corresponding length.

**🧩 Example Output**
{'apple': 5, 'bat': 3, 'banana': 6}

**⚙️ Concepts Used**

For Loops – for iteration over lists.

Dictionaries – for mapping data.

String Functions – to calculate word length.

Key-Value Relationships – to store dynamic data pairs.

**🏁 Outcome**

This program helps understand how to dynamically build and update dictionaries in Python.
It’s a foundational exercise for learning how to structure and process textual data efficiently.
