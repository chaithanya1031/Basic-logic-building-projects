**🔡 Character Frequency Counter**
**📘 Description**

This program counts how many times each character appears in a given string.
It helps analyze character frequency — including spaces, letters, digits, and symbols.

**🧠 Example**

Input:

enter random string: hello world


Output:

{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, ' ': 1, 'w': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1}

**⚙️ Working Logic**

The program takes a random string as input from the user.

It loops through each character in the string.

Using a dictionary, it keeps a count of how many times each character appears.

Finally, it displays the character frequency in dictionary format.

**🚀 Features**

Counts all characters (letters, numbers, spaces, and symbols).

Uses a dynamic counting mechanism — works for any input length.

Simple, efficient, and beginner-friendly logic.

**🧰 Use Cases**

Text analysis and pattern detection.

Basic frequency statistics for strings or documents.

Useful for learning how dictionaries work in Python.
