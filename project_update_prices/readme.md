**🍎 Update Prices (10% Increase)**
**📘 Description**

This Python program increases the price of each item in a dictionary by 10% and stores the updated prices in a new dictionary.
It’s a simple way to apply a percentage-based update to product prices or costs.

**🧠 Example**

Input Data:

{
  'apple': 100,
  'banana': 40,
  'cherry': 60
}


Output:

{'apple': 110.0, 'banana': 44.0, 'cherry': 66.0}

**⚙️ Working Logic**

* A dictionary items holds item names and their original prices.
* A new empty dictionary updated_prices is created.
* The program loops through all key–value pairs in items.
* Each price is increased by 10% using the formula:
    new_price = value * 1.10
* The updated prices are stored in the new dictionary.
* The result is printed with all adjusted prices.
